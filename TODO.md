# To-Do List for Drip Email Campaign Automation Tool

---

## General Requirements

- [ ] Automate email campaigns with a drip sequence until a prospect responds.
- [ ] Support multiple concurrent campaigns.
- [ ] Provide monitoring and reporting on campaign performance.
- [ ] Use the SendGrid API for reliable email delivery.
- [ ] Ensure scalability, modularity, and reliability in the solution.
- [ ] Separate business logic from user inputs.

---

## Workflow Design
### 1. Input Preparation

**The user provides input files:**
- Contact list (contacts.csv)
- Email template (templates.yaml)
- Event schedule (schedule.json)

### Input Parser
**Features**:
- Validate and parse input files (contacts, templates, schedule).
- Convert data into standardized Python data structures.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `load_contacts` function: Parse CSV files and validate field completeness.
- [ ] Implement `load_templates` function: Parse YAML files and handle placeholders (e.g., `{name}`).
- [ ] Implement `load_schedule` function: Parse JSON files and validate date-time format.

---

### 2. Campaign Initialization
- Create the initial status of each campaign, including contacts, templates, and schedules.
- Register campaign status in the campaign manager (e.g., "Not Started", "In Progress", "Completed")

### Campaign Manager
**Features**:
- Manage campaign states (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- Track progress for each contact.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `initialize_campaign` function: Initialize campaigns and store states.
- [ ] Implement `start_campaign` function: Start a specified campaign.
- [ ] Implement `update_campaign_status` function: Update progress for contacts (e.g., Email Sent, Reply Received).
- [ ] Implement `get_campaign_status` function: Query the current state of campaigns.

---

### 3. Campaign Schedule
- The scheduler triggers campaigns according to user-defined schedules.
- Generates personalized email content for each contact.
- Distributes tasks to email sending modules.

### Scheduler
**Features**:
- Trigger campaigns based on user-defined schedules.
- Manage the sequential sending of emails within campaigns.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `schedule_campaign` function: Schedule the initial email of a campaign.
- [ ] Implement `schedule_next_email` function: Schedule the next email for a contact after a specified delay.
- [ ] Implement `run_scheduler` function: Start the scheduling loop and execute real-time tasks.

---

### 4. Email Delivery
- Send emails through SendGrid API.
- Retry failed sends.
- Record send status and notify campaign manager to update status.
### Email Sender
**Features**:
- Send emails using the SendGrid API.
- Handle errors and implement retry mechanisms.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `send_email` function: Send emails via SendGrid and return success or failure status.
- [ ] Implement `validate_email` function: Validate email formats.
- [ ] Implement error handling mechanisms: Include retry logic and exponential backoff.

---

### 5. Reply and stopping
- Use Webhook or periodic checking to monitor replies.
- If a contact replies, stop sending subsequent emails to that contact.

---

### 6. Statistics Collection
- Get email engagement data (e.g., open rate, click-through rate) from the SendGrid API.
- Store statistics in a local database (e.g., SQLite) or file.
- Generate campaign summary reports periodically.

### Statistics Tracker
**Features**:
- Retrieve email engagement data (open rates, click-through rates, replies) from the SendGrid API.
- Generate campaign statistics reports.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `track_email_status` function: Fetch engagement metrics for individual emails.
- [ ] Implement `log_campaign_statistics` function: Record statistics for campaigns.
- [ ] Implement `generate_report` function: Generate an overall report of campaign performance.

---

### 7. Logger
**Features**:
- Log system events, errors, and campaign activities.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement `initialize_logger` function: Configure logging to files and the console.
- [ ] Implement `log_event` function: Record logs at different levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.).

---

### 8. Error Handling
**Features**:
- Ensure system stability in cases of input errors, API failures, and scheduling conflicts.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Handle invalid input files and provide user-friendly error messages.
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff retry logic for API calls.
- [ ] Skip invalid email addresses while continuing campaigns.
- [ ] Record and automatically handle scheduling conflicts.

---

### 9. Deployment and Configuration
**Features**:
- Support local and cloud-based execution.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.
- [ ] Use environment variables to manage sensitive data (e.g., SendGrid API keys).
- [ ] Write configuration file templates (sample contacts, templates, schedule files).

---

### 10. Testing and Documentation
**Features**:
- Ensure functionality of all modules.
- Provide comprehensive user and developer documentation.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Write unit tests (Input Parser, Campaign Manager, Scheduler, Email Sender, Statistics Tracker).
- [ ] Write user guide: Instructions on how to run the script.
- [ ] Write developer guide: Detailed explanation of module designs and implementations.
